abstract: >-
  WaveDL is a deep learning framework built for wave-based inverse problems —
  from ultrasonic NDE and geophysics to biomedical
  tissue characterization. It provides a robust, scalable training pipeline for
  mapping multi-dimensional data to physical quantities, with support for
  memory-mapped datasets, multi-GPU distributed training, and HPC deployment.
